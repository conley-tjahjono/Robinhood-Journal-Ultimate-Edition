# Robinhood-Journal-Ultimate-Edition
Robinhood has released this feature where you can export all trading data in a given timeframe.

My goal is to use that data to gather the following:
> Options Trading
> Share Trading
> Interest Data
> Stock Lending Data
> Dividend Data
> ACH Totals
> Gold Totatls
